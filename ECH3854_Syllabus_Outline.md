2. Flow diagrams and pseudocode
3. MATLAB syntax and variables (symbols, strings, vectors, matrices, structures)
4. Vector and matrix indexing
5. Conditional statements
6. Nested loops
7. Data visualization (tables, plots, histograms)
8. Input-output operations (functions, spreadsheets, GUIs, DAQ cards)
9. Efficient programming (random number generation, memory usage, commenting)
10. Deterministic and random variables (uniform, Normal, binomial, periodic)
11. Statistics (PDFs, mean, variance) and confidence intervals
